# Types

## bbox

A bounding box that describes which part of the map the user is currently viewing.

* `top` (number, min: -90, max: 90): The latitude of the north end of the box
* `bottom` (number, min: -90, max: 90): The latitude of the south end of the box
* `left` (number, min: -180, max: 180): The longitude of the west end of the box
* `right` (number, min: -180, max: 180): The longitude of the east end of the box
* `zoom` (number, min: 1, max: 20): The current zoom level. This is relevant for the density of track points that
  should be received. 

## marker

* `id` (number): The ID of this marker
* `lat` (number, min: -90, max: 90): The latitude of this marker
* `lon` (number, min: -180, max: 180): The longitude of this marker
* `name` (string): The name of this marker
* `colour` (string): The colour of this marker as a 6-digit hex value, for example `ff0000`
* `size` (number, min: 15): The height of the marker in pixels
* `symbol` (string): The symbol code for the marker. Default is an empty string.
* `shape` (string): The shape code for the marker. Default is an empty string (equals `"drop"`).
* `elevation` (number): The elevation of this marker in metres (set by the server)
* `typeId` (number): The ID of the type of this marker
* `data` (`{"key", "value"}`): The filled out form fields of the marker

## line

Each line has `routePoints` and `trackPoints`. The `routePoints` are the start, end and via points that the user created
for that line, the `trackPoints` describe how the line should be drawn. If no routing is used, `routePoints` and
`trackPoints` are equal, but with routing, there will be a lot more `trackPoints` than `routePoints`.

When creating or updating a line, the `trackPoints`, `distance` and `time` properties are automatically calculated by
the server. Only when the routing mode is `track`, the `trackPoints` can be specified by hand (meant for importing
existing tracks, for example from a GPX file). The `idx`, `zoom` and `ele` properties of the track points are added by
the server automatically.

Note that `line` objects coming from the server donâ€™t contain the `trackPoints` property, but the track points are sent
separately through `linePoints` events.

* `id` (number): The ID of this line
* `routePoints` (`[{lat, lon}]`): The route points
* `mode` (string): The routing mode, an empty string for no routing, or `car`, `bicycle`, `pedestrian`, or `track`
* `colour` (string): The colour of this marker as a 6-digit hex value, for example `0000ff`
* `width` (number, min: 1): The width of the line
* `name` (string): The name of the line
* `distance` (number): The distance of the line in kilometers (set by the server)
* `ascent`, `descent` (number): The total ascent/descent of the line in metres (set by the server)
* `time` (number): The time it takes to travel the route in seconds (only if routing mode is `car`, `bicycle` or `pedestrian`) (set by the server)
* `left`, `top`, `right`, `bottom` (number): The bounding box of the line (set by the server)
* `typeId` (number): The ID of the type of this line
* `data` (`{"key", "value"}`): The filled out form fields of the line
* `trackPoints`:
  * In the `lines` property of the client, an object of the format `{"<idx>": trackPoint}`
  * When creating/updating a line with the routing mode `track`, an array of the format `[trackPoint]`

## trackPoint

All track points have a `zoom` level and are only received when the zoom level of the current bbox is at least that
level. This makes sure that at a small zoom level, only a low resolution of the line has to be downloaded. When zooming
in, only the additional track points are retrieved. They can be merged into the already retrieved track points using
their `idx` property.

* `idx` (number): The index of this track point in the list of all track points of this line
* `lat` (number, min: -90, max: 90): The latitude of this point
* `lon` (number, min: -180, max: 180): The longitude of this point
* `zoom` (number, min: 1, max: 20): The miminum zoom level from which this track point makes sense to show
* `ele` (number): The elevation of this track point in metres (set by the server). Not set for high zoom levels.

    * `oldName` (string): When renaming a field (using [`editType(data)`](./methods#edittype-data)), specify the former name here
    * `type` (string): The type of field, one of `textarea`, `dropdown`, `checkbox`, `input`
