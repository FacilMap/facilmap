# Configuration

The config of the FacilMap server can be set either by using environment variables (useful for docker) or by editing `config.env`.

FacilMap makes use of several third-party services that require you to register (for free) and generate an API key:
* Mapbox and OpenRouteService are used for calculating routes. Mapbox is used for basic routes, OpenRouteService is used when custom route mode settings are made. If these API keys are not defined, calculating routes will fail.
* Maxmind provides a free database that maps IP addresses to approximate locations. FacilMap downloads this database to decide the initial map view for users (IP addresses are looked up in FacilMapâ€™s copy of the database, on IP addresses are sent to Maxmind). This API key is optional, if it is not set, the default view will be the whole world.
* Mapzen is used to look up the elevation info for search results. The API key is optional, if it is not set, no elevation info will be available for search results.
